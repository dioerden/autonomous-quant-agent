### 🧠 Strategic Context
1. **Killzone Analysis:** London Open (07:00 UTC / 14:00 WIB). Anticipated high volatility and a potential "Judas Swing" (false move down before reversal).
2. **AI Confirmation:** Deep Learning model (7-dim state) provided a **BUY** signal at the 14:00 candle.
3. **Technical Confirmation:**
   - **Trend:** Bullish alignment on 15m, 1h, and 4h timeframes.
   - **Momentum:** RSI healthy at level 51.
   - **EMA:** Crossover EMA9 > EMA21 confirmed on the 15m chart.
4. **Sentiment & Macro:**
   - **Fear & Greed:** Level 21 (Extreme Fear - historically a buy zone for institutions).
   - **DXY:** Weakening trend noted, providing a tailwind for crypto.

### 📝 Execution Notes
- Initial limit order set at 124.50 was not hit immediately as the price showed strong upward momentum.
- Executed market buy at 125.80 based on `london_executor.py` confirmation.
- Resilient `pnl_monitor.py` active to track live performance.

### 🔍 Post-Mortem: Limit Order at 124.50
- **Actual Low (14:00-16:00 WIB):** **$125.43**
- **Result:** Limit Order NOT hit.
- **Why?** The "Judas Swing" (false move down) was shallower than expected. Strong institutional demand at the 125.40-125.50 area created a support floor, preventing the price from reaching our deep liquidity level at 124.50.
- **Lesson:** In high-momentum sessions like London Open, having a Market Buy "Plan B" (which we executed) is critical to avoid missing the primary move.
